## Introduction

**Overview of the App and Its Objectives:**
The Market Research App aims to identify high-demand products by scraping data from platforms like eBay, Facebook Marketplace, and local classifieds. This app will provide users with insights into trending products, enabling them to make informed purchasing decisions.

## Requirements

**Technical Requirements:**
- **Python**: Programming language for backend development.
- **Flask**: Micro web framework to build the web application.
- **Beautiful Soup**: For web scraping and data extraction.
- **Requests**: To handle HTTP requests.

**User Requirements:**
- User-friendly interface for easy navigation.
- Quick access to trending product data.
- Responsive design for mobile users.

## Architecture

**Overview of App Architecture:**
- **Backend Scraping Logic**: 
  - `ebay_scraper.py`: Scrapes data from eBay.
  - `facebook_scraper.py`: Scrapes data from Facebook Marketplace.
  
- **Frontend Interface**: 
  - A Flask app serving a user-friendly web interface where users can input search terms and view results.

## Functionality

**Detailed Description of Each Feature:**
1. **Product Search**: Users can enter a search term to find trending products.
2. **Data Display**: Scraped data will be displayed in a clear and organized manner.
3. **Filtering Options**: Users can filter results by category or price range.

## User Interface Design

**Mockups or Descriptions of UI Elements:**
- **Search Bar**: Prominently placed at the top of the page for easy access.
- **Results Display Area**: Below the search bar, showing product names and prices in a grid format.

## Testing Strategy

**Outline of Testing Phases:**
- **Unit Tests**: Test individual components (scrapers, data handling).
- **Integration Tests**: Ensure all parts work together as intended.
- **User Acceptance Testing**: Gather feedback from initial users to improve the app.

## Deployment Plan

**How the App Will Be Deployed and Maintained:**
- Host the app on platforms like Heroku or DigitalOcean.
- Regularly update the scraping logic to adapt to changes on eBay and Facebook.

## Future Enhancements

**Potential Features for Future Versions:**
- Historical price tracking for products.
- User accounts for saving favorite searches and products.
- Notifications for price drops or trending items.

## Project Management Plan

1. **Milestones**:
   - Week 1: Complete initial scraping functionality.
   - Week 2: Develop the Flask app interface.
   - Week 3: Implement testing strategy and gather user feedback.
   - Week 4: Deploy the app and initiate marketing efforts.

2. **Task Assignments**:
   - Assign roles to team members based on expertise (development, testing, marketing).
   - Use project management tools like Trello or Asana to track progress.

## UI/UX Plan

1. **Color Scheme**:
   - Use a simple, modern color palette:
     - Primary Color: **#4CAF50** (Green)
     - Secondary Color: **#FFFFFF** (White)
     - Accent Color: **#FFC107** (Amber)

2. **Retention and Layout Specificity**:
   - Use a mobile-first design approach.
   - Ensure buttons are large enough for easy tapping on mobile devices.
   - Maintain consistent spacing and margins for a clean layout.

3. **UI Elements**:
   - Search Bar: Full-width, with rounded corners and a slight shadow.
   - Product Cards: Display product image, title, and price with hover effects.

4. **User Engagement**:
   - Use tooltips to guide users on how to use features.
   - Implement feedback forms to collect user suggestions.
